My library is designed to make progress bars in Python easy and flexible. Whether you need a simple or more advanced bar, this library is ideal.

PyPI link: https://pypi.org/project/terminalbars/

Installation:

pip install terminalbars


or, to upgrade:

The library helps you create progress bars such as pasek, superpasek, propasek, ultrapasek, and ultrapropasek. All functions work the same way – only the starting point (name) differs.
